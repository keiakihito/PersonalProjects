# DataStructureAndAlgorithm 
Cal Poly Pomona Data Structure and Algorithm Class projects

# Data Structure (CS2400)
 - **Project 1** - Bag, which is a duplicated random order element list. Implementing three different methods using a Resizeable array list and linked list.

 - **Project 2** - Stack application. Implementing convert to postfix method and evaluating postfix evaluation method using a Resizeable array list and linked list.

 - **Project 3** - Tree. Implementing Post-order traversal and binary node and constructing the given picture tree structure. 

 - **Project 4** - Graph. Implementing adjacency list representation and neighbor methods which returns an array containing the neighbors of vertex. 

# Algorighm (CS3100)
 - **Project 1** - Matrix Multiplication. Implementing three different matrix multiplication methods<br> 
    * 1.Classiacal matrix multiplication
    * 2.Divide and Conquer matrix multiplication
    * 3.Strassen matrix multiplication
 <br><br>Deriving each method's time complexity mathematically, getting the average execution time to make a plot, and analyzing and comparing the theoretical aspect and practical execution time. 

# C++SampleProjects
- **2D_Pointer_and_plane** - The project demonstrates the application of a 2D pointer for sheet availability of airplane and computer lab sheets.

- **DataStracture** - Manual implementation of linked list, Stack, and Queue
