## Numerical Analysis (MTA 4010)
[Abstract](https://github.com/keiakihito/PersonalProjects/tree/main/NumericalAnalysis)
 - **Final Project** - Comparing Numerical methods and algorithms with finding eigenpairs or solving Ax = b in terms of large-size Numerical Linear Algebra<br>
   
   - Mathematical derivation.
   - Execution time analysis.
   - Residual analysis.
 <br><br>Considering each algorithm's mathematical background, investigating a total of 3 experiments.

## Operating System (CS 4310)
[Abstract](https://github.com/keiakihito/PersonalProjects/tree/main/OperatingSystem)
 - **Project** - Simulating Job Scheduler of the Operating Systems by programming the following four scheduling algorithms that we covered in the class.<br> 
   - First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
   - Shortest-Job-First (SJF)
   - Round-Robin with Time Slice = 2 (RR-2)
   - Round-Robin with Time Slice = 5 (PR-5)
 <br><br>The program displays four algorithms job processes in a table format and calculates the average turnover time(ATT). It compares the mean of ATT for each job group.

   - Classiacal matrix multiplication.
   - Divide and Conquer matrix multiplication.
   - Strassen matrix multiplication.
 <br><br>Constructing each algorithm's time complexity, getting the average execution time to make a plot, and analyzing and comparing the theoretical aspect and practical execution time. 

[Abstract](https://github.com/keiakihito/PersonalProjects/tree/main/Algorighm)
 - **Project 2** - Search Algorithms. Implementing three different search algorithms for analysis.<br> 
   - Merge sort.
   - Quick sort.
   - Median of Medians.
 <br><br>Constructing each algorithm's time complexity, getting the average execution time to make a plot, and analyzing and comparing the theoretical aspect and practical execution time. 

## Data Structure (CS 2400)
[Implementaion details](https://github.com/keiakihito/PersonalProjects/tree/main/DataStructure)
 - **Project 1** - Bag, which is a duplicated random order element list. Implementing three different methods using a Resizeable array list and linked list.

 - **Project 2** - Stack application. Implementing convert to postfix method and evaluating postfix evaluation method using a Resizeable array list and linked list.

 - **Project 3** - Tree. Implementing Post-order traversal and binary node and constructing the given picture tree structure. 

 - **Project 4** - Graph. Implementing adjacency list representation and neighbor methods which returns an array containing the neighbors of vertex. 

## Assembly Language (CS 2640)
[MIPS programming projects](https://github.com/keiakihito/PersonalProjects/tree/main/AssembleLanguage)
 - **Program 1** - Display "Hello World" in MIPS assembly language.

 - **Program 2** - Accept 5 integers and calculate its average.

 - **Program 3** - Realizing ineger arrays, the program asks the user to remove or edit values and see the result. It also computes the sum and product of the remaining values.
   
 - **Program 4** - The program asks these 4 choices: Replace a value, Calculate the sum of all values, Print out the 2D array, and Exit. The program keeps these choices until the user wants to exit the program. 

 - **Program 5** - Creating subroutine to record 10 students' information, a name of type string of up to 40 characters, age of type integer, and an ID of type integer.
