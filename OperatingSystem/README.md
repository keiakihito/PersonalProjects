# Operating Systems (CS 4310)
## Project  Abstract
<br><br>
Simulating Job Scheduler of the Operating Systems by programming the following four scheduling algorithms that we covered in the class:

* First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
* Shortest-Job-First (SJF)
* Round-Robin with Time Slice = 2 (RR-2)
* nd-Robin with Time Slice = 5 (PR-5)

The project generates multiple testing cases with inputs of 5 jobs, 10 jobs, and 15 jobs, 20 cases each, for 60 files. The program will read process burst times from a file, job.txt, and execute the four algorithms above. A sample input file of five jobs is given as follows (burst time in ms). The program displays four algorithms job processes in a table format and calculates the average turnover time(ATT). It compares the mean of ATT for each job group.
