# Design and Analysis of Algorithms (CS 3310)
## Project 1 Abstract
<br>
This project asks to implement, test, and analyze the three different matrix multiplication algorithms discussed in class. The matrix size starts 2 by 2 until the maximum size my device can handle due to running out of memory. The input size will be limited in the power of 2 as 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 up to $2^{k}$ where k is the largest size of the Integer. The reason for the power of 2 is to ease the programming component of the assignment.
